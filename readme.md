# Mazoku Legends

## About

Mazoku Legends is a MMORPG based on Japanese mythology! It is currently a proof of concept built on the Sepolia Testnet, and the Web3.js library.

It demonstrates the following:

* Multiplayer capability
* Chat functionality that lets you send XRP
* Smart contract: The Blacksmith holds the key to the Sword NFT (ERC721) Smart Contract. 
* Mint NFT: speak to the Blacksmith to forge your own Sword NFT! Act quick because the initial supply is 500 (now at 499!)
* Fight the Dark Lord! If you win, you get ETH. If you lose, you send the Dark Lord some ETH.
* The Dark Lord can only be defeated with a sword (this dApp checks if you are an owner).
